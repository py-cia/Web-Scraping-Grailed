Amazing cargo pants that will last you a LIFETIME. It's beefy and got a really amazing structure to it. Contains 9 pockets and a velcro strap on the bottom to taper if needed. I have the reese cooper tags as well if you would like to have those for your collection :)
Worn at most 4-5 times and washed once by hand. The condition is pretty much brand new tbh. Purchased for retail at $540. Measurements were taken from an online retailer but they are accurate.
Shipping will be done with USPS Priority (2-3 business days) and will include additional insurance.
