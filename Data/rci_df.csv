Love these boots. Absolutely amazing construction, all the details are painstakingly conceived. Italian leather, the Vibram sole, the hardware. My favorite part is definitely the creativity allowed by the lacing.<U+0001F90C>
Didn’t wear these much. Very clean, the only flaws are that 3/4 aglets are missing on the laces, I don’t have the alternate laces, and there is no box. A bit of dirt on the sole.

Bought from another user. This is the Spring 2021 version with a suede collar. It has a cropped, boxy fit in comparison to other jackets so double check measurements. IMO it looks best with some higher rise pants, something around 11”.
It has some light wear on the collar and a couple of small marks (look at the sleeve pic). Otherwise in great condition.

Reece cooper released a DIY chore jacket set a while ago and this is how the guy who sold it to me turned out. I wore it once but it was too small for me. I’m normally a large/x-large but I took a risk so here I am selling it again.
Some parts were made incorrectly, but they don't take away from the intended look.
Reese Cooper dropped this a few years back. The concept was really cool. Basically you bought the materials straight from Reese Cooper to make your own jacket at home. It came with a link to a YouTube video (which you can find to this date) which showed you how to make it. You had to cut and sewed everything.","Outerwear"
