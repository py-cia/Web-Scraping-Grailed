Made from fine Italian leather and wool, the jacket is adorned with chenille patches and features chain-stitched embroidery across the back including a detailed “smokejumper” - specially trained firefighters who play a valuable role in combating remote wildland fires by parachuting directly into them.
Finished with the adjustable chest strap, signature RCI hook detail and sleeve patch.

Custom × Reese Cooper,Reece Cooper DIY chore jacket,7,Condition New,Color Beige,Size Men's / US M / EU 48-50 / 2,$100 ,3,TRUE,"**** the patches have not been sewed on but I have them and will include them. ****
Reece cooper released a DIY chore jacket set a while ago and this is how the guy who sold it to me turned out. I wore it once but it was too small for me. I’m normally a large/x-large but I took a risk so here I am selling it again.
Some parts were made incorrectly, but they don't take away from the intended look.
Reese Cooper dropped this a few years back. The concept was really cool. Basically you bought the materials straight from Reese Cooper to make your own jacket at home. It came with a link to a YouTube video (which you can find to this date) which showed you how to make it. You had to cut and sewed everything."
