Special capsule collection to commemorate AW21 Runway show at Mt. Wilson observatory. All proceeds went to the National Forest Foundation and Mt. Wilson Observatory.
Built in the early 1900s led by George Ellery Hale, the Observatory is home to the 100-inch Hooker telescope where Edwin Hubble made the groundbreaking discovery confirming that the Andromeda Galaxy was indeed its own galaxy. Visited by Einstein and other preeminent scholars, Mt. Wilson has been the cornerstone of advanced astronomy.
